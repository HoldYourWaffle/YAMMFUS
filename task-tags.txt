In addition to Eclipse's default tags (TODO, XXX, FIXME) the following task tags are used:
NOTE - low priority notes that could be usefull for later bugfixes
FUTURE - low priority tasks that must be done in the future
NOW - high priority tasks that indicate where I have to work on next
STUB - normal priority tasks that indicate this method/class isn't "build" yet
